Websites I used to help
stackoverflow.com - many of the errors that I would get throughout testing my code was found to be solved in this website
https://airbrake.io/blog/python-exception-handling/eoferror - for EOF error
https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/error-handling/python-try-and-except - for try and except help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcUlMsVX7aE&feature=share - YouTube video to help me understand pipes
https://www.python-course.eu/pipes.php - trying to understand how to use os.pipe()

These collaborations were mainly discussed and not much of sharing code. Only time code was actually looked at was when fixes and errors were occuring.

The following list will go number the people I Collaborated with and in what topic and my code is numbered to wherever I got the help:
1. Alex Melendez - she helped with figuring out how to set the paramaters of list in order to concatinate and append correctly and she also helped me fix my parameters so it can do simple commands. She also reexplained how redirects should work and how the parameters should be stored.
2. Elizarda Baeza - he also helped me with fixing my paramters and figuring out how to do echo and commands that are of length of two. He also warned me to make sure I use a while loop in order to implement exit properly and keep the shell going
3. Andreas Maurer - I shared the knowledge that I had about redirections
4. Brandon Delgado - He warned me about using the "Command not found" handler so that it prints out the error message when it's supposed to. He also helped me figure out how to implement cd
5. Victor Luna - We discussed redirections a little bit just so that I can make sure we understood properly 
6. Fernando Martinez - he helped with the understanding of I/O and flags/variables
